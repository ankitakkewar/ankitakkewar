       **CONFIG FILE OF SSH**

        /home/admin/.ssh/id_rsa
      /home/admin/.ssh/id_rsa.pub      
             **KEY PATH**

server side:

* First we have to check ssh package are install or not.
  for that use this command
 # firewall-cmd --list-all

* Check status of ssh system for that command
 # systemctl status ssh

* Generate key for key authntication
 # ssh-keygen

* Bydeault create .ssh directry within this .ssh create 
  public key and private key
  id_rsa  id_rsa.pub

* for inform kernal system create a authorized_keys file
   and copy the public key in that file.
 # cat id_rsa.pub > authorized_keys
  from this command automatically create and copy contain
  from id_rsa.pub file

* authorized_keys file need only user permission for 
  security purpose only root user can be acess
 # chmod 600 authorized_key

* Send private key to user who we give acess that user
 #scp id_rsa root@123.23.0.3:/mnt

 root ki jagh koi bhi user ho skta,jo bhi user key genrate
 krke clint ko send krega uska login name our @ uske baad 
 us hi user ki ip fir : deke location dalna jidhar key paste 
 krna hai krte time client ka passward ek time dalna pdta hai

client side: 

*jis location mai key send ki ho server ne us location mai
 jane ka for ex: cd /mnt

*fir ssh lene ke liye command dalna hai
 # ssh -i id_rsa root@123.23.0.2
 root means jo bhi user jiska acess lena hai our jis user
 ne private key send ki hai uska name then @ then usi user
 ka ip adress

*without asking passward server ka acess milana chahiye agar 
 mil jaye acess to service barabar ho gyi execute
